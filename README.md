# nist-cve-scraper
A simple web scraper that will retrieve the latest CVE data from the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov) and build objects in a local database. **Please note that this project is still in development.**

**Getting Started**
Because this is in development, these notes are subject to change.
1) Install python (tested on 2.7.X currently)
2) Install PiP by [running this script with Python](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
3) [Install VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (optional) 
4) pip install -r requirements.txt
5) python manage.py makemigrations (one time to create the database schema)
6) python manage.py migrate (one time to build the database)

**TO DO**
1) Implement autometed cron-like capability which will grab the latest daily feed. NIST provides an RSS feed, so this may be the best route.
1) Create better unit tests
1) Implement [Django-rest-framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for an API capability (this should be configurable)
1) Probably more requirements because scope creep is a thing
